I'm trying to predict where people are likely to perceive that a transition between two neighborhoods.
I have been collecting data from Craiglists about which neighborhood real estate listings claim to be in. I take
these data, do some processing, and identify different neighborhood areas. I then find the borders between these areas
and that is my target data. (the 'pixels' in this case are populated US Census blocks). 

![Target borders](images/border.png)

Ultimately, this is a vector that has the length of the number of edges between adjoining census blocks. [This vector](images/data/border.csv) 
takes a value of 1 if this edge is a border between two different neighborhoods and a 0 otherwise. 

I then calculated a number feaures about these edges: do they intersect a [railroad line](images/data/rail_intersects.csv), what is the [difference in 
the racial distribution of the blocks](images/data/js_race.csv), etc. I then use weighted logistic regression to build a model
of the probability that an edge between two census blocks will be a border between neighborhoods. Right now,
the probabilty of an edge being a border is treated as if it were independent of other edges being borders. 

The below image shows the predicted values from the model. The bright red lines are edges that have an estimated probability
of being a neighborhood boundary over 0.4. The darker red lines have an estimated probability of being borders between
0.3 and 0.4.

A few more notes about the model: using dummy variables, I'm basically specifying two different models, one for edges
between uninhabited census blocks where I use physical and administrative features and a richer model for edges
between inhabited census blocks, where I use census features.
